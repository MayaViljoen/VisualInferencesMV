# VisualInferencesMV
				Story Board Visual Illusory Inferences 


## GOALS:


To see whether non linguistic visual paradigms  can trigger reasoning with alternative possibilities// question answer dynamics 

To create a paradigm that can be used to test adults - and pre linguistic infants 

Predict : Higher fallacy rate in target trials than in baseline// no controls 

Predict: fallacy rates to be lower than linguistic paradigm. 

## Welcome Text & Consent 
**Consent** 
We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from ENS.

The purpose of the study is to learn about visual illusory inferences

We will ask you to fill out a questionnaire in English, involving such tasks as reading sentences or words, naming pictures or describing scenes, deciding what sentences follow from other sentences, or participating in simple language games. If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this experiment, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time.  However, please note that in order to validate the HIT you need to complete the experiment and type in the code you will get at the end on the HIT's page on Mechanical Turk.  Otherwise we have no way to process your payment.

There are no risks or benefits of any kind involved in this study. You will be paid for your participation at the posted rate.

Your participation in this study will remain confidential.

Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from this study.You may print this form for your records.
By ticking the box and clicking on the button at the bottom of this page you indicate that you are at least 18 years of age, that you understand this statement, and that you agree to complete this HIT voluntarily

Taken from Previous reasoning experiment consent form 


## Welcome text

**Familiarization**

  'You will be presented some videos. Watch them carefully and press continue to move on. '

	FAMILIARIZATION phase: contains 5 scenes - Single branch pipe introducing the gates, the bridge and the occluders. A button CONTINUE will appear on the screen and be active once the movie ended. 


Prompt Test text: 'Get ready to provide some answers! Place your index and middle fingers on the J and K keys of your keyboard. Press the key that matches your selection as soon as you made your decision.'

 'Get ready to provide some answers! Click on the box that matches your selection as soon as you make your decision.' 
(Comments: for this we need to provide YES and NO buttons and let the participant click with the mouse).

NOTES FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT

Familiarization Trials : 1-4****will b same for this exp


## Test Trial: Future: Possibility
**Which Gate do you think will open?**
* J
* K
* I don’t know 

An answer of J adds evidence to visual question answer dynamics taking place.
 An answer of 3: evidence that original version : interpretive// linguistic mechanisms
Is mirroring included?

## No Control: Future:Necessity
**Is it Guaranteed that gate J will open?**
* Yes
* No

Baseline Subtraction: Exclude those that say yes ?

## Yes Control: Future:Necessity
**Is it Guaranteed that gate K will open?**
* Yes
* No

Exclude those that say no?

## Test Trial: Future:Possibility
**Which Gate do you think will open?**
* J
* K
* I don’t know 

## No Control: Past: Necessity
**Is it Guaranteed that gate J was opened?** 
* Yes
* No

Baseline Subtraction: Exclude those that say yes ?

## Yes Control: Future:Necessity 
**Is it Guaranteed that gate K will open?**
* Yes
* No


## Yes Control: Past:Necessity
**Is it Guaranteed that gate K was opened?**
* Yes
* No


## Test Trial: Past:Possibility
**Which gate do you think was opened?**
* J
* K


## No control: Past:Possibility
**Which gate do you think was opened?**
* J
* K
Testing for bias? 


## Yes control: Past:Possibility
**Which gate do you think was opened?**

What is the question here?
Do you think gate k was opened?
Testing for bias?

BASELINE : Minimally different from test trial : do not reveal top left gate open!-> filter out biasses : ?


## My Questions 

**Test Trial: Past:Possibility& Yes Control:Past: Posibility**

Disjunctive Trial & Target trial  
 
Do we show the outcome here, surely since this is a test trial involving reasoning in terms of past possibility the participant should see the outcome?


**No Control future**
A similar question here, showing the outcome (3 parallel gates)
By representing the outcome but asking a future question, this confuses me, as the particpant is aware that the water has already come through (some sort of past representation), yet must predict whether J is guaranteed to open
